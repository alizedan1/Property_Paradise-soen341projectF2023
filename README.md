# SOEN341_Real_Estate_Project


Project Approach and technology:

Since we are tasked at creating a web app and the goal is to practice our AGILE approach and ability to complete a team project effectively, we decided to focus our effort on the proccess 
and approach to finding a suitable solution. We decided to find a blueprint online (possibly on github) for a webpage design for web app that we think we could easily adapt for our needs. 
Ideally a page written in HTML/CSS. We can later use javascript for additional functionalities. If the page has bootsrap that would be a plus for the visual representation of the page otherwise we will add bootstrap manually as it makes it easier to design the page. We will also include jQuery library as it makes searching for elements more easy and there are a lot of functionalities like clicking and searching that we will be able to implement more easily as opposed to just plain javascript.
We will utilize firebase for the user registration/authentication (sign up/ sign in process), data storage and we could utilize firebase cloud functions if need be ustilizing Node.js as the backend framework.
