# SOEN341_Real_Estate_Project

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The main objective for this project is to create a real estate web application in which many functionalities will be implemented such as thd buying, selling and renting of home properties. This web app will reunite 4 main users by creating a hub in which the process of real estate transactions will be facilitated. The homebuyers, property renters, system administrators and the real-estate brokers will find in our web app the required functionalities in the transaction pipeline. For the homebuyers, they will be able to search home properties for sale, specific to their criterias such as price location, number of rooms and amenities. They can also save and create a list of favourite properties. They can request a visit of the property and can independently search for brokers. They also have access to a mortgage calculator. The property renters have similar functionalities apart from the mortgage calculator. The brokers can request a visit, manage visits by cancelling or rescheduling, submit offers and manage offers, match properties to potential buyers and can do CRUD operations on the properties listing. The system administrators are able to do the CRUD operations on the brokers. These are the basic features that will be available for all our users and if some are added in the future they will be described in this part of the README. 


Project Approach and technology:

Since we are tasked at creating a web app and the goal is to practice our AGILE approach and ability to complete a team project effectively, we decided to focus our effort on the proccess 
and approach to finding a suitable solution. We decided to find a blueprint online (possibly on github) for a webpage design for web app that we think we could easily adapt for our needs. 
Ideally a page written in HTML/CSS. We can later use javascript for additional functionalities. If the page has bootsrap that would be a plus for the visual representation of the page otherwise we will add bootstrap manually as it makes it easier to design the page. We will also include jQuery library as it makes searching for elements more easy and there are a lot of functionalities like clicking and searching that we will be able to implement more easily as opposed to just plain javascript.
We will utilize firebase for the user registration/authentication (sign up/ sign in process), data storage and we could utilize firebase cloud functions if need be ustilizing Node.js as the backend framework.
