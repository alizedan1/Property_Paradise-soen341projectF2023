Notes:
This is the first phase of acceptance testing, login may not be a precondition met yet.
Once the login is done each user will have their own user-id so now a test-id can be used to do the acceptance test. 

After testing:
CRUD functions worked as expected, the user was able to add, view, edit and delete properties. As mentioned a unique user id with login,
is to be tested in the future, but the CRUD functions worked as expected by the test.
