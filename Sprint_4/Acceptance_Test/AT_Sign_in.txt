Acceptance test: User Sign_in and navigation to the user page.

Preconditions: The user is on the Sign_in page.

Steps:

1) Enter valid credentials.
   - Go to the login page.
   - Enter a valid email address and password.
   - Click on the "Sign_in" button.

   Result: The system authenticates the user with Firebase using the provided credentials.

2) Login verification
   - After clicking "Sign_in", verify that the user has successfully logged in.
   - Check if there are any error messages indicating failed login attempts.

   Result: The system logs the user in correctly without any error messages.

3) Check user's page is directed to correct page.
   - After successful login, check the navigation to the user page.
   - Make sure that the user is redirected to the user page.

   Result: The system correctly navigates the user to the user page after successful login.

4) Verify user information in Firebase
   - Access the Firebase database to verify that the user information (email, user ID, credentials) has been loaded correctly at sign_in.
   - Verify that the user's authentication status is marked as logged in.

Result: User information is successfully stored in Firebase and the authentication status is updated to reflect the login status.

5) Login test with incorrect credentials
   - Go to the login page.
   - Enter incorrect credentials (e.g. incorrect password).
   - Click on the "Login" button.

   Result: The system should display an error message indicating that the login attempt failed due to incorrect credentials.


Postconditions: User successfully logs in and the system successfully navigates to the user page. The user's information is correctly 
stored in Firebase. Unsuccessful login attempts are handled appropriately.

Notes: The focus of this acceptance test is to ensure that the login process is secure and accurate, including authentication of the 
user with Firebase and proper navigation to the user page after successful login.
