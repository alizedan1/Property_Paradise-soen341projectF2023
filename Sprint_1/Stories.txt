Stories for 4 different types of users.

Story 1: Homebuyers

This type of user is a customer and therefore needs a user-friendly interface that is attractive to them. It should be
designed keeping in mind that this user is an average adult who has access to a computer. Therefore, it should be kept in
mind that this user's only intention is to look for homes and that the user should not have any software-related problems
as this is the type of user is the one that will be using most of the site, and their needs come first.

Some of the tools that will be provided to them are those that allow them to search for properties based on location, price
range, number of bedrooms, dimensions, time of listing, property year, property type (Condo, Single Family Homes, Duplexes,
etc.), and other user tools if needed.

The software will offer this user the ability to search for brokers, monthly payment calculators, and contacts to view 
properties or request a visit button. This type of user will not necessarily need an account to use the site, as there will be
a place where you can put your name, email, and phone number to be contacted by the broker to schedule a visit.

Ultimately, this may change in the future, but these are the basic needs that the Homebuyers type of user will need on the
website. Therefore, this is the initial proposal with what the software for the user (Homebuyer) will start to be created.
