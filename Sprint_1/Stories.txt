Stories for 4 different types of users, will allow the members of the team to know the different requirements of the
different users and help for the sprints to come.

Story 1: Search for Properties

The property search is going to be used by two types of users such as homebuyers and property renters. This is the core of
the website, as it is the main function that customers will use. Next, this property search function will need filters such
as location, price range, number of bedrooms, dimensions, release date, property year, and property type (condos, single-
family homes, duplexes, etc.). A user-friendly interface will be needed, as it will be used by the average user with access
to a computer and basic knowledge.

Story 2: Request for Visits for Properties

The renter has similar needs to the homebuyer, must be able to search the different types of properties and have different 
filters than the homebuyer such as price range/ included amenities, electricity, internet. He/she can request an appointment to view the property. If an account is created in the system 
this user will be able to have favorite properties, to be able to compare their different options. He will be able to search 
for brokers. But he will not have a mortgage calculator as he does not need this utility. So the important thing for this user, 
who is one of our main clients, is to have an easy to use interface and to provide all the basic functionalities to the user 
and help him find a property to rent. 



Story 3: System Administrator(s)

The system administrator needs to have access mainly to broker information and is able to accept or reject brokers, as well as 
information from other users in case there is a need for CRUD in their case. Therefore, he/she must have access to data that 
allows identifying the broker and verifying that it is indeed a trusted broker.  The database that will be used to give you 
access in this case is firebase. In this database you will be able to create, read, update and delete. Therefore, you must have 
privileged access to the system. In this case a friendly user interface is not really necessary, since the important thing is to 
allow the system administrator to solve problems within the system. We consider that this type of user has a higher degree of 
expertise in the software, so a friendly user interface is not necessary. However, this user should be chosen with care and his
 or her background should be checked, as he or she will have access to customer information.

Story 4: Real-State Brokers/landlord
Brokers/Landlord must be able to post new offers on the page. These offers must contain the option to add a title, at least 4 images and a space to include a large description of the rental/real estate property. There must also be a selection option to choose between renting or selling houses. There must also be a selection option during the post creation process to include which type of rental property it is (condo, appartment, house, mansion). Once the post is created, there will need to be an option to edit your post which will allow the user to modify the title, images and description. Finally the user should have the option to delete the post.
