Stories for 4 different types of users, will allow the members of the team to know the different requirements of the
different users and help for the sprints to come.

Story 1: Search for Properties

The property search is going to be used by two types of users such as homebuyers and property renters. This is the core of
the website, as it is the main function that customers will use. Next, this property search function will need filters such
as rent or buy, location, price range, number of bedrooms, dimensions, release date, property year, and property 
type (condos, single-family homes, duplexes, etc.), broker. If it is rented it will have additional things such as included amenities, electricity, and internet. A user-friendly interface will be needed, as it will be used by 
the average user with access to a computer and basic knowledge.

Story 2: Request for Visits for Properties

In this case, users such as property buyers and tenants must be able to request property viewings. In this case, to access 
this feature, we will require the user to create an account. In this case, to access this feature, we will ask the user to 
create an account that will enable them not only to request a visit but also to bookmark properties. This will enable better 
management of visit requests. And better communication with customers who want to rent or buy, with our other type of 
customer, the brokers. This will enable the system to ensure that brokers are vetted and that property buyers and renters 
can reliably book appointments to view the property.


Story 3: System Administrator(s)

The system administrator needs to have access mainly to broker information and is able to accept or reject brokers, as well as 
information from other users in case there is a need for CRUD in their case. Therefore, he/she must have access to data that 
allows identifying the broker and verifying that it is indeed a trusted broker.  The database that will be used to give you 
access in this case is firebase. In this database you will be able to create, read, update and delete. Therefore, you must have 
privileged access to the system. In this case a friendly user interface is not really necessary, since the important thing is to 
allow the system administrator to solve problems within the system. We consider that this type of user has a higher degree of 
expertise in the software, so a friendly user interface is not necessary. However, this user should be chosen with care and his
 or her background should be checked, as he or she will have access to customer information.

Story 4: Real-State Brokers/landlord
Brokers/Landlord must be able to post new offers on the page. These offers must contain the option to add a title, at least 4 images
and a space to include a large description of the rental/real estate property. There must also be a selection option to choose between
renting or selling houses. There must also be a selection option during the post creation process to include which type of rental property 
it is (condo, appartment, house, mansion). Once the post is created, there will need to be an option to edit your post which will allow the
user to modify the title, images and description. Finally the user should have the option to delete the post.
